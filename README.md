## How to configure a fresh system

```bash
# Ensure that at least `curl` and `git` are installed
# `vim` is recommended
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuzianHahn/dotfiles/debian/.local/installer/dotfile_installer.sh | bash 
# e.g. on alpine systems, `bash` is not included. Use `sh` in this case.
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuzianHahn/dotfiles/debian/.local/installer/dotfile_installer.sh | sh
